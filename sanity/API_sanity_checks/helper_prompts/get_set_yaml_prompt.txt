You are given API documentation containing multiple APIs, it can contain one ore more fields like these:

* **API Name** 
* **Signature** 
* **Returns** 
* A category: either **Get APIs** or **Set APIs**

Your task is to produce a YAML file in the following structure:

```yaml
interface_x:
  set:
    - <list of all Set API names from the provided documentation>
  get:
    - <list of all Get API names from the provided documentation>
```
interface_x can be interface_1 to interface_5 depending on the API documentation.

**Rules:**

1. If the API name given to you says "AddDevice" you have to use "add_device"
2. Group all APIs under `set` if they are in the **Set APIs** section.
3. Group all APIs under `get` if they are in the **Get APIs** section.
4. Keep the YAML indentation exactly 2 spaces per level.
5. The output should be **pure YAML only**, without explanations or extra text.
6. Output should be enclosed in code block i,e within ```yaml ```

**Example:**

If given:

Get APIs

 get_address
 get_commands

Set APIs

acknowledge_or_resolve_alert

Then the output should be:

```yaml
interface_1:
  set:
    - acknowledge_or_resolve_alert
  get:
    - get_address
    - get_commands
```
